# Introduction

This tutorial guides you through building and working
with an example simulation model, showing you along the way some
of the commonly used OMNeT++ features.

The tutorial is based on the Tictoc example simulation, which you
can find in the `samples/tictoc` directory of your
OMNeT++ installation, so you can try out immediately how
the examples work. However, you'll find the tutorial much more useful
if you actually carry out the steps described here.
We assume that you have a good C++ knowledge, and you are in general
familiar with C/C++ development (editing source files, compiling, debugging etc.)
To make the examples easier to follow, all source code in here is
cross-linked to the OMNeT++ API documentation.

This document and the TicToc model are an expanded version of
the original TicToc tutorial from Ahmet Sekercioglu (Monash University).
